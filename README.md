# FlockJS

Real-time collaboration primitives for the web.

FlockJS is an open-source, framework-agnostic SDK designed to help frontend teams add multiplayer collaboration features without building custom realtime infrastructure from scratch.

## Project Status

FlockJS is currently in **early development** and this repository is building toward a production-ready `v1.0`.

- API contracts in this repo are the current canonical direction.
- Some packages and features documented here are **planned** and not fully implemented yet.
- Breaking changes are expected before `v1.0`.

## Why FlockJS

Building collaboration features usually requires you to stitch together transport, peer lifecycle, presence state, conflict resolution, and reconnection behavior. FlockJS focuses on delivering these as composable primitives:

- `room` lifecycle and peer registry
- `presence` for who is online and what they are doing
- `cursors` for live pointer positions
- `state` for synchronized shared data
- `awareness` for ephemeral UI context
- `events` for fire-and-forget signals

## Feature Overview

| Area                | Description                                   | Status    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Core room lifecycle | `createRoom`, connect/disconnect, peer events | Planned   |
| Presence engine     | peer metadata, subscriptions, updates         | Planned   |
| Cursor engine       | pointer sync, rendering helpers               | Planned   |
| Shared state engine | `lww`, `crdt`, `custom` merge strategies      | Planned   |
| Awareness engine    | transient focus/typing/selection state        | Planned   |
| Event engine        | ephemeral room and peer-targeted events       | Planned   |
| React adapter       | provider + hooks API                          | Planned   |
| Vue adapter         | plugin + composables                          | Planned   |
| Svelte adapter      | stores + actions                              | Planned   |
| Relay server        | optional WebSocket relay for scale            | Available |
| Prebuilt UI kit     | cursors/presence/typing components            | Planned   |

## Quick Start (Planned API)

```bash
npm install @flockjs/core
```

```ts
import { createRoom } from '@flockjs/core';

const room = createRoom('my-first-room', {
  transport: 'auto',
  presence: { name: 'Alice', color: '#4F46E5' },
});

await room.connect();

const presence = room.usePresence();
presence.subscribe((peers) => {
  console.log('Peers in room:', peers.length);
});

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  void room.disconnect();
});
```

## Package Matrix

| Package             | Purpose                                 | Status    |

| `@flockjs/core`     | room, transports, collaboration engines | Planned   |
| `@flockjs/react`    | React provider/hooks                    | Planned   |
| `@flockjs/vue`      | Vue plugin/composables                  | Planned   |
| `@flockjs/svelte`   | Svelte store/action integration         | Planned   |
| `@flockjs/cursors`  | prebuilt collaboration UI components    | Planned   |
| `@flockjs/relay`    | self-hosted relay server                | Available |
| `@flockjs/devtools` | debugging and diagnostics tooling       | Available |

## Relay CLI and Docker

Install the relay as a global CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @flockjs/relay
flockjs-relay --port 8080
```

Relay runtime environment variables:

| Variable          | Default     | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`            | `8787`      | TCP port the relay listens on                                            |
| `HOST`            | `127.0.0.1` | Interface the relay binds to. Docker examples override this to `0.0.0.0` |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | unset       | Optional concurrent WebSocket connection cap                             |
| `FLOCK_REDIS_URL` | unset       | Optional Redis URL used to coordinate multiple relay instances           |

Docker image:

```bash
docker pull flockjs/relay:latest
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 flockjs/relay:latest
```

Compose examples:

```bash
# Local image build
docker compose up --build

# Local build with Redis coordination
FLOCK_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0 docker compose --profile redis up --build

# Production image
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Monorepo Setup

Issue `EP-01 #001` scaffolds this repository as a `pnpm` + `turborepo` monorepo with buildable package stubs.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `20` for local development (pinned via `.nvmrc` and `.node-version`)
- Runtime compatibility baseline for published packages: Node.js `18+`
- `pnpm`

### Install and Validate

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm typecheck:root
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
```

Release tooling commands:

```bash
pnpm changeset
pnpm version-packages
pnpm release:status
```

`pnpm version-packages` applies version bumps and updates package-level `CHANGELOG.md` files.

Type checking is split intentionally:

- `pnpm typecheck`: runs per-workspace checks through Turbo.
- `pnpm typecheck:root`: runs a root `tsc --noEmit` over `packages/*` and `apps/*`.

Testing is package-scoped for this sprint:

- `pnpm test`: runs Vitest via Turbo for `packages/*`.
- `pnpm test:watch`: starts package test watch mode.
- Coverage reports are emitted under `packages/<name>/coverage`.

CI/CD baseline for EP-01 `#005`:

- PR validation runs on every PR to `main`.
- Validation runs on Node `18` and `20`.
- Pipeline order: install -> lint -> typecheck -> test -> build.
- Release workflow triggers on `v*` tags, publishes `@flockjs/*` via Changesets, and publishes `flockjs/relay` to Docker Hub.
- Changesets release PR workflow (`.github/workflows/changesets-release-pr.yml`) runs on pushes to `main`.
- Release workflow requires `NPM_TOKEN`, `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, and optionally uses `TURBO_TEAM` / `TURBO_TOKEN`.

### Workspace Layout

- `packages/*`: core SDK and adapters (`@flockjs/*`)
- `apps/*`: internal applications
- `examples/*`: placeholder examples for future implementation
- `benchmarks/`: placeholder benchmark suite

## Development Direction

Project execution is tracked across 6 sprints and 9 epics:

- Foundation and repository setup
- Core transport and room lifecycle
- Collaboration engines
- Framework adapters and relay
- Advanced capabilities and DX
- Docs, testing, and launch
