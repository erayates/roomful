## Transport Characteristics

| Metric                    | WebRTC (P2P) | WebSocket relay | BroadcastChannel  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Typical same-city latency | 8-30ms       | 15-50ms         | <1ms              |
| Recommended room size     | 8-12 peers   | 500+ peers      | same-browser only |
| Setup complexity          | low          | medium          | low               |

Binary codec note:

- WebRTC and relay websocket transports can switch from JSON to MessagePack after peer negotiation.
- BroadcastChannel stays JSON-only so same-origin tabs share a stable text envelope.
- Mixed-version or json-only peers automatically downgrade to JSON rather than failing the room.

## Optimization

### Cursor Throughput

```ts
const cursors = room.useCursors({
  throttleMs: 16,
  smoothing: true,
});
```

### Shared State

- Prefer `patch` to reduce payload churn.
- Avoid synchronizing large nested objects.
- Keep transient data in `events`, not `state`.

### Awareness

- Keep awareness semantic (typing/focus/selection).
- Do not stream high-frequency pointer coordinates through awareness.

## Scaling Path

1. Start with `transport: 'auto'`.
2. Let `auto` stay on BroadcastChannel for same-origin browser contexts.
3. Use WebRTC for smaller cross-machine rooms when direct mesh is viable.
4. Move to websocket relay for sustained larger rooms or constrained networks.
5. Add horizontal relay scaling as concurrency grows.

Redis-backed relay validation:

- Set `FLOCK_REDIS_URL` on two relay instances that share the same Redis deployment.
- Run `pnpm --filter @flockjs/relay benchmark:redis` with that Redis URL in the environment.
- Compare the Redis cross-instance benchmark to the single-instance baseline and keep added median latency under `5ms` for local validation.

Relay load validation:

- Run `pnpm --filter @flockjs/relay benchmark:load:steady` for the single-room 100-peer baseline.
- Run `pnpm --filter @flockjs/relay benchmark:load:scale -- --redis-url redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0` for the 500-peer, 50-room, 3-relay cluster scenario.
- Run `pnpm --filter @flockjs/relay benchmark:load:soak -- --redis-url redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0` for the 30-minute soak and inspect `benchmarks/results/<run-id>/report.md`.
- Increase `--vus` on the scale scenario to document the first concurrency level where latency thresholds or error-rate checks fail.

## Validation Targets

- Stable cursor updates at expected peer count
- Predictable reconnect behavior under packet loss
- Controlled state payload growth over long sessions
