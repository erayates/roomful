# Release Process

Audience: contributors and maintainers.

## Goals

- Predictable versioning across packages
- Clear changelog communication
- Safe promotion from pre-release to stable

## Versioning Model

- Semantic Versioning intent (`major.minor.patch`)
- Independent versions per publishable package (`@flockjs/*`)
- Pre-`v1.0` may ship frequent minor-level API adjustments
- Breaking changes must be explicitly called out in PRs and changelog

Changesets is the canonical versioning tool:

- `pnpm changeset`
- `pnpm version-packages`
- `pnpm release`

Changelog model:

- Root `CHANGELOG.md` is project-level narrative.
- `pnpm version-packages` auto-generates package `CHANGELOG.md` files for bumped `@flockjs/*` packages.

## Publish Scope

- Published: `packages/*`
- Internal only: `apps/*`, `examples/*`, `benchmarks/*`

## Workflow Overview

1. Contributor adds a changeset file in PR (`pnpm changeset`).
2. PR CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) validates on Node `18` and `20`.
3. Maintainers merge release-ready changes into `main`.
4. `.github/workflows/changesets-release-pr.yml` auto-creates/updates a release PR on `main`.
5. Release PR contains version bumps and package changelog updates from `pnpm version-packages`.
6. Maintainers merge the release PR.
7. Maintainers push tag matching `v*`.
8. Tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
9. Release workflow validates, publishes to npm via Changesets, and publishes the relay Docker image to Docker Hub.

## Pre-Release and Stable Strategy

- Use pre-release tags to validate significant API changes.
- Promote to stable after testing and compatibility checks.

## CI/CD Contracts

PR validation pipeline order:

1. install
2. lint
3. typecheck
4. test
5. build

Release trigger:

- Git tag push matching `v*`
- Changesets release PR workflow runs on push to `main`

Release secrets:

- `NPM_TOKEN` (required)
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` (required for relay image publish)
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (required for relay image publish)
- `TURBO_TEAM` (optional)
- `TURBO_TOKEN` (optional)
